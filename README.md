# 🧠 Employee Salary Prediction App

An intelligent web application built using **Machine Learning** and **Streamlit** to predict whether an employee earns **more than $50K** or not based on key demographic and work-related factors.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

In many organizations, identifying high-earning employees plays a critical role in decision-making processes such as promotions, taxation, and resource allocation. However, manually evaluating income ranges based on multiple employee attributes can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project focuses on automating this classification task using a trained machine learning model that predicts if an individual earns more than $50K per year based on selected features.

## 🛠️ System Development Approach

### ✅ System Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pickle
- Pandas, NumPy

### ✅ Required Libraries:
- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`
- `pickle`

These libraries were essential for data processing, model building, and creating the interactive user interface for real-time predictions.

## 🔄 Algorithm & Deployment (Step-by-Step Procedure)

1. **Data Collection**: The UCI Adult Income Dataset was used as the base dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Irrelevant columns were removed; necessary columns were encoded.
3. **Model Training**: A `Gradient Boosting Classifier` was trained on the processed dataset.
4. **Model Saving**: The trained model and encoders were saved using `pickle`.
5. **App Interface**: A responsive and color-themed web app was created using Streamlit.
6. **Deployment**: The app was run locally with `streamlit run app.py`, and is ready for deployment to cloud platforms like Streamlit Sharing or Heroku.
